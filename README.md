# BasicCalculator
This is my very first Python coding project. 

You have the option to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Once the code displays the answer, it will automatically close after three seconds. 

When cloning the application to run,
  I found it best to open the terminal and select where you'd like to file to be cloned and then type in git clone (link). 
  It will then clone, next you can open the application by typing the file name "BasicCalculator.py"
